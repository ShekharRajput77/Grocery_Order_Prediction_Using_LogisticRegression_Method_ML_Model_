This project implements a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn to predict the status of data entries (e.g., "Canceled" or "Not_Canceled"). The dataset is preprocessed, trained, and evaluated for accuracy. The final model is used to predict and update the status column for a prediction dataset.

**Features**

Handles missing values in both numerical and categorical data. Encodes categorical variables using Label Encoding. Splits data into training and testing sets. Trains a Logistic Regression model. Evaluates model accuracy on the test set. Applies the trained model to predict status for new data. Downloads the updated dataset after predictions.

**Model_Accuracy** - 96.38%

**Note**: Status column - Not_Canceled:0, Canceled:1
